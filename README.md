# Project 1: Static website deployment in AWS ElasticBeanstalk using AWS CodePipeline and Terraform Workspaces

Hello everyone,

With this project you will be able to test AWS ElasticBeanstalk as well as AWS CodePipeline. The IaC is handled using Terraform and for this project i have also used 2 workspaces, one for development and another for production.

This project uses 3 modules i wrote to create the Elasticbeanstalk Application, Environment and CodePipeline. Each environment will have its own VPC.

If you are interested in test this project i invite you to my [Medium.com post](https://medium.com/@cristian.dente/static-website-deployment-in-aws-elasticbeastalk-using-aws-codepipeline-and-terraform-workspaces-4a76a98598d6).
